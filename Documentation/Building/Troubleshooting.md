# Possible problems.

1. Screen not turning on:
Some users of the MKS Base V1.6 have reported that the screen will not turn on. This happened for us as well. We Solved the problem by cutting off the plastic key on one end of each of the screen cables, and rotating the connector in the socket. This solved the problem.

1. Some of the parts from the LVE were not necessary to print. Please evaluate each part and decide if it is necessary for your individual setup. We found that the Syringe guide and syringe collar did not adequately secure the syringe, and therefore were not necessary. Also the Needle adapter, needle collar, 250 um Needle jig, 18-guage needle jig short, and 18-guage needle jig extended should only be evaluated for printing if you plan on also using the syringe pump in a bioprinter.

1. The 16mm screws were too long for our stepper motor. We assumed that the manufacturers have different hole depths. So we solved the problem by putting two nuts on the screws before screwing them into the motors.

1. The 17-guage needle did not fit as snugly as we would have liked, and so we used a small dab of super glue to seal the needle to the tube. Just make sure not to seal the needle.
