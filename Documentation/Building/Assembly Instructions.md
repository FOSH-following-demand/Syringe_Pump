# Steps

1. Purchase all of the parts from the [Electrical bill of materials](Hardware/Bill_of_Materials/Electrical_BOM.csv) and the [Mechanical bill of materials](Hardware/Bill_of_Materials/Mechanical_BOM.csv)
2. 3D print all the necessary [parts](Hardware/Frame/3D_Printed_Parts)
3. Assemble the syringe pump body by following the directions found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468067217300822#!)
4. Remove the control knob from the Smart Display

5. Attach the MKS-Base v1.6 and the Smart Display to the controller cabinet using M3 X 8 screws
  -Note: Depending on the tolerances and nuances of every 3D printer, and different part manufacturers, the fit of the MKS-Base and Smart Display might be a little off. Only two screws are necessary to hold the parts in place, and some of the cabinet may need to be shaved down with a razor blade for the screen to fit.
6. Replace the control knob

7. If the power supply has an extendable plug, attach it to the board and feed the wires through the power port

8. Place syringe pump body on the top of the case. Put two M3 X 45 screws through the two holes by the bearing and feed them through the last slot on the case. Attach with washers and M3 nuts. Note: I did not have any M3 nuts on hand, so I improvised with some larger nuts to hold mine in place.
9. Drill two holes with the 7/64th drill bit towards the front of the pump body, and drill through the pump and the case. Push two M3 X 45 screws in and fasten with M3 nuts and washers. Note: If you drill too close to the edge of the case, you will be unable to put a nut and washer on that screw.
