# Getting Started

### Initialize EEPROM
After you have uploaded the firmware you must initialize EEPROM for the changes to take effect. Do this after any firmware is uploaded from the computer to the pump
1. Plug in your syringe pump
2. Press the control knob to access the menu
3. Go to Control > Initialize EEPROM > Initialize EEPROM. You should hear a beep

### Using the pump

Using the pump is very simple. The pump can push out volumes in three different step sizes: 5mL, 1mL or 0.5mL at a time.
1. Press the control knob to access the menu
2. Go to Prepare > Pump > Pump E0
   -All of the other options under pump are for the other ports on the board. These can be used to control multiple syringe pumps from one control unit. The name of the option corresponds with the name of the port that subsequent pumps would be connected to
3. Select the volume size you would like to pump
4. Turn the knob clockwise to pump out liquid and turn it counterclockwise to suck in liquid.
