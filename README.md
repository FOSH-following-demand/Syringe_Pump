# Syringe Pump

We are a team of 4 people from Utah, USA. We creating a open source DIY syringe pump from commonly available and 3D printed parts that allows for high accuracy and repeatability. We also want to make this project as simple as possible so that no specialized skills are required.

The syringe pump that will be built will then be able to be integrated with almost any commonly available DIY 3D printer to create a bioprinter. We then aim to create a guide to help troubleshoot common issues with creating good quality bioprints.
