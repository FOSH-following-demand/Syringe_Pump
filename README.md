# Syringe_Pump_and_Bioprinter

We are a team of 4 people from Utah, USA. We want to create a open source DIY syringe pump from commonly available parts that allows for high accuracy and repeatablility. This syringe pump will then be able to be integrated with almost any commonly available DIY 3D printer to create a bioprinter. We then aim to create a guide to help troubleshoot common issues with creating good quality bioprints.
